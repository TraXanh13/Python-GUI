# Python-GUI
Learning the basics of craeting a Python GUI through built in library, tkinter<br><br>

## Project Purpose and Goals
Purpose:
<ul>
    <li>Learn the basics of tkinter</li>
    <li>Input game scores (Kills, Deaths, Assist) to get expected workout/punishment</li>
</ul>

Goals:
<ul>
    <li>Create "different scenes" for the different processes</li>
    <li>Create a visually pleasing/proper flowing navigation</li>
